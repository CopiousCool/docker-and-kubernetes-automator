Docker/Kubernetes Management Python Script Documentation

This Python script is designed to provide basic management functionality for Docker and Kubernetes accounts, as these two technologies are often used in conjunction with each other.

It allows you to manage Docker and Kubernetes tasks. Docker is a software platform that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. A container is like a lightweight virtual machine that contains all the necessary components to run an application. Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a tool for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts.

The script allows you to perform common tasks like checking which Docker images are currently running, their health and uptime, and whether any software needs to be updated. It can also perform other common Docker and Kubernetes tasks, like creating new containers and deploying them, scaling applications, and managing networking.

The code works by using the Docker and Kubernetes APIs to interact with the Docker and Kubernetes environments. The APIs are essentially a set of rules and protocols that define how different applications can communicate with each other. By using these APIs, the script is able to perform a wide range of tasks, from checking the status of containers to creating and deploying new applications.

Overall, the script is a powerful tool for managing Docker and Kubernetes environments, allowing you to automate many common tasks and save time and effort.

Prerequisites
Before using this script, you must have Docker and Kubernetes installed on your system and have valid credentials for your Docker and Kubernetes accounts.

Getting Started
To use this script, you must first clone the GitHub repository and install the necessary dependencies. The following command can be used to clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/docker-kubernetes-management.git


After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the script with the following command:
python docker_kubernetes_management.py

Functionality

The following is a list of the functions provided by this script:

check_images(): Checks for currently running Docker images and their status
check_health(image_name): Checks the health of a Docker image
check_uptime(image_name): Checks the uptime of a Docker image
check_outdated(): Checks for any running Docker images with outdated software
deploy_kubernetes(deployment_file): Deploys a Kubernetes deployment using a YAML file
delete_kubernetes(deployment_name): Deletes a Kubernetes deployment by name

Examples
Checking currently running Docker images and their status:
check_images()


Checking the health of a Docker image:

check_health('nginx')


Checking the uptime of a Docker image:

check_uptime('nginx')


Checking for any running Docker images with outdated software:

check_outdated()


Deploying a Kubernetes deployment using a YAML file:

deploy_kubernetes('deployment.yaml')


Deleting a Kubernetes deployment by name:

delete_kubernetes('nginx-deployment')
